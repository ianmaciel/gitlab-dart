# GitLab API

This is a dart library to communicate with the [GitLab API v4](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/README.html).

**This is still work in progress.** We are happy about Merge Requests!

This library is already in production use, but it is missing a lot of calls and properties.

The calls that *are* present should be safe to use.

There are still tests missing for a lot of resources though.

## Installation

Simply add it to your project as a dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  gitlab: any
```

## Usage

For the full documentation, and usage, please
